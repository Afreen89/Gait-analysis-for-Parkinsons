# Gait-analysis-for-Parkinsons
This repository contains the code from a masters thesis about the gait analysis for Parkinson's disease.
There are files related to a comparison between machine learning models and deep learning models.
There is a MATLAB file for creating gait energy image from seven images. There a code of Mask RCNN which was used to extract the mask (human silhouete) from the images.

# Motivation 
I worked on the future works of [A novel computer vision based gait analysis technique for normal and Parkinsonâ€™s gaits classification] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9251179)
